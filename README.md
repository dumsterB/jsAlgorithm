# jsAlgorithm
to be honest, i got this piece of code from internat which was written on python and convert it on js , i am not sure it is correct or now but it was a some difficult task for me while mostly i solved this kind of tasks
i don't know this was for middle developer or strong junior but i ask to help from 2 middle js developers and they can't to solve it also
